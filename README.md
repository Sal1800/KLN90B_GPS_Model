This is an open source 3D model and textures for the KLN90B GPS unit that can be used for MSFS aircraft. You will need the associated HTML code from https://github.com/falcon71/kln90b. 

To import into your own aircraft Blender model, append the collection. This will bring in the mesh objects and materials. Move the root object to position it into your panel. 

The provided textures are only the albedo and emissive parts.
